# Seven Segment Displays
Seven Segment Displays are a kind of display consisting of, as the name implies, 7 different segments, often with the addition of a decimal point. Seven segment displays are good at displaying numeric data but often are much harder to understand when trying to display letters.

Most LED seven segment displays commonly used in electronics projects will have 10 pins, A-G for the segments, COM which is for ground, and DP for the decimal point. These 10 pins are split between the top and bottom 5. 

Top:    G, F, COM, A, B
Bottom: E, D, COM, C, DP

Here is which segment each pin connects to
