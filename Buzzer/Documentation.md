# Active & Passive Buzzers
Active and Passive Buzzers are important components in electronics. They are most commonly used to send audio from the electronics. For example, if you made something and you wanted to let the user know if the battery is about to die you can use a buzzer to send a buzz out telling the user that the machine's battery is dead. Buzzers can also be used to make music when the need for high quality sounds isnt needed. For example, a little jingle that can play when your machines battery gets pluged in.

Active and Passive Buzzers can serve a very similar purpouse, but to get to the same outcome both components use different methods.

### Active Buzzers
Active Buzzers contain a built-in oscillator which will ocilate the metal disk inside of it when powered, which creates sound. Active Buzzers are powered with Dirrect Current (DC).

### Passive Buzzers
Passive Buzzers do not contain a built-in oscillator, meaning that you have to tell the buzzer to move the disk by sending alternatic current (AC).
