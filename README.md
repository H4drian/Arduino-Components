# Arduino Components
This is a collection of piece of code I've writen to help work with commonly found components in electronics projects. I've writen all of the code to function with arduino microprocessors (specifically the UNO). Along with code for the components I've added documentation on all of the components and circuit diagrams to help with understanding how certain components function and when or why to use them.
